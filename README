# README

This is the manual for the performance analysis of TCP variants.

See The final pdf paper under the project root directory.

===============================================================================

Unpack the sample data

For those who have not installed NS-2/TCL for executing the experiments, I
have prepared a sample data package 'plot_data.tar.gz'. Simply run:

tar -xzvf plot_data.tar.gz

And you will get the sample data unpacked under out directory, so that you
can directly run 'make' and generate the LaTeX paper.

===============================================================================

Makefile

The project root directory is perf_analysis_tcp_variants.

Run 'make exp1/exp2/exp3' would run experiment1, experiment2 and experiment3
respectively. Running an experiment includes running the tcl script to do the
simulation, and then run a Python script to do analysis to the output trace
file. The analysis results would be save to 'out' directory for plotting.

Run 'make expall' would run experiment 1, 2, 3 respectively.

Run 'make plot' would kick off gnuplot to plot the analysis result for each
experiment, note that you need run the experiments to get the data before
plotting, or gnuplot would complain about there is no data for plotting. Since
we use LaTeX to make the paper, so what gnuplot generates is an eps picture
and with a LaTeX postscript, instead of jpg/png. The plotting files would be
placed under 'paper' directory for LaTeX compilation usage.

Run 'make' would kick off pdflatex to generate the whole paper. 'make' depends
on 'make plot'.

Project Directory Layout

ns2: contains all the tcl simulation scripts.

process: contains all the Python analysis scripts.

plot: contains all the gnuplot scripts.

paper: contains all LaTeX files for the final paper.

out: a placeholder for the experiments output data files.

All functional operations are controlled by the Makefile.
Note that you may not make the plotting successfully, because we did not
submit the plotting data. To make the plotting and paper by yourself, you
need to run the 3 experiments first.
